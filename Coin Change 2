*****QUESTION*******
You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.

 

Example 1:

Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1
Example 2:

Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
Output: 0
Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
Example 3:

Input: amount = 10, coins = [10] 
Output: 1
*******************
class Solution:
    def change(self, amount: int, coins: List[int]) -> int:
        l = [0*i for i in range(amount+1)]
        l[0] = 1
        for j in coins:
            for k in range(len(l)):
                if k>=j:
                    l[k] += l[k-j]
        return l[-1]
